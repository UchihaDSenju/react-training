package.json contains the dependencies
node modules is the folder where all the dependencies are installed, it is created when we run the create-react-app command
How React runs:
index.html<div id="root">(in public)<-index.js<App />(in src)<-App.js(here we write what must be seen in div tag)

Use PascalCase for naming fo .js files
